              <p>Hey Canvas+ Users,</p>
              <br>
              <p>This extension was released just three weeks ago, and already has ten users and two 5 star reviews! Thanks for your continued support.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pgrp no-indent">
              <p>As more people are downloading the extension, I believe it is important to maintain it and continue to make Canvas better. Today, <b>Canvas+ has been updated to version 0.1 on the Chrome Webstore.</b> This article is the official changelog for <b>Canvas+ 0.1</b>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Improved Popup</h2>
            <div class="pgrp">
              <p>The Canvas+ popup has been completely redesigned to grant more power to you! The popup had previously only shown you the extension version your browser was running, but now, as seen below, you'll have quick access to changelogs like these, be able to toggle Canvas+ features, and in a future update, you'll be able to change your <b>Canvas display settings.</b></p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6To04Z0.png" alt="Image of new Canvas+ Popup" width="238px" height="373px"></img></div>
            </div>

            <h2>Search Bar</h2>
            <div class="pgrp">
              <p>The goal of this extension has always been to improve your Canvas navigation. Canvas+ version 0.1 is delivering a new navigation tool: the search bar. This will allow you to quickly navigate to course content anywhere on Canvas. <b>Please Note: To collect search results, this feature will affect the "History" button on Canvas. It will not affect your general browser history.</b></p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YFxrtrN.png" alt="Image of new Canvas+ Search Bar" width="250px" height="218px"></img></div>
            </div>

            <h2>Faster Links</h2>
            <div class="pgrp">
              <p>Depending on your school, internet, and other external factors this could be a monumental change for you: We've added a feature (toggleable in settings) called <b>Speed Boost</b> which will preload any links in Canvas for a faster loading time. As mentioned, a lot of factors will determine how useful this is for you. Our testing has seeen <b>2x speed improvements</b> under average conditions.</p><b>Please Note: To collect preload links, this feature will affect the "History" button on Canvas. It will not affect your general browser history.</b>
