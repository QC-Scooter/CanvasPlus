# üñ•Ô∏è  Develop

I'm happy to collaborate on this and any pull request will be accepted if they improve the extension. *All chrome extensions are coded in JavaScript* and google has some great resources to learn more about developing chrome extensions. For now, here's a rundown of what everything does and some useful functions:

<br><br>
**manifest.json**

> The manifest file contains everything necessary for chrome to start the extension. Most should be pretty self-explanatory. If you want to add any sort of color modes and you're getting an error, you want to put a link to any programatically loaded css files in the `web_accessible_resources` array.

<br><br>
**popup files**

> Popup files are the HTML/CSS/JS for the popup shown when you click the extension button.

<br><br>
**quicklink.js**

> This is NOT my code. I barely know how it works, so DO NOT modify it.

<br><br>
**background.js**

> Unsurprisingly, this code is run in the background. Right now its only use is the 'Thank you for installing!' and update popups
