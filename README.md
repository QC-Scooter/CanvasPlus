# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice About Summer Updates - 5/26
The extension is always being maintained, but during the summer, updates\* will NOT be released on chrome (Firefox will still recive updates though). For people doing summer school and/or really interested in the project, updates WILL be released on GitHub. All updates made over the summer will be released in one large update around the end of August. I've decided to not update major web browsers because updating the extension would generally involve a popup letting people know the extension has been updated. I don't imagine people want to think about school during the summer, and I wouldn't want to risk losing any users when we could just not bother anyone by releasing all the summer changes at the end of August. \*The one exception to this is if someone ports the extension to a new browser, I'll publish it to its web store over the summer, since there's no active users who could be annoyed by an update notification.

Also, you can expect less updates over the summer in general, because its harder to develop when you don't have courses that are actively being updated.
Thanks!

# üìö  About
Canvas+ is a free chrome and firefox extension that improves the experience of students using Canvas, with support for the following toggleable features:

- Smart Scrolling
- Search Bar
- Faster Links
- Dark Mode

These can be toggled by clicking the extension popup.

<br><br>
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're interested in porting this to another browser, do NOT publish it! Why?
It's really inconvenient for me, the maintainer of this project, to go to you whenever I want to push out an update. I can't garuantee that you'll be active on GitHub and/or willing to maintain the extension, so its much better if I own the extension. If you wan't to port to another browser, fork this repo, make the port, pull request, and I'll do the work of publishing it.

<br><br>
# üìå  Known Issues
All code has errors, and Canvas+ is no exception. Here's all the known issues and their statuses:

<br>

1. Popup and sidebar customization (these issues are related) is currently broken on firefox (fixes coming soon)

<br>

**Have a different issue?**

Be sure to report it in the <a href="https://github.com/adrWasTaken/CanvasPlus/issues">issues tab</a> and I'll do my best to fix it!

<br><br>
# üìÖ  Planned Features

Here's a list of some planned features for the extension, in order of when they're coming:

- Bug Fixes
- "Dim" Mode
- Email Peeker
- Drap and drop to upload
- Upload from clipboard
- Change sidebar: Hide branding, change size, etc
- Quick Navigator
- Customize link & accent color
- Pin/bookmark pages/discussion posts
- Email signatures
- Add filters to search (Overdue/late assignments, certain classes, etc)
- Show own discussion posts at the top of a discussion.
- Sort discussions by likes and/or interaction
- Access zoom links from extension popup
- (Potential) Discussion signature
- (Potential) Automatically export course content for offline viewing

If you want to add any of these, I'll accept your pull request!
If you have an idea of your own, I'll probably also merge it, but you might want to check with me. You can contact me (<a href="https://github.com/adrWasTaken">more details on my github profile</a>), or make an issue in this repo, and I'll let you know what I think!

# üñ•Ô∏è  Develop

I'm happy to collaborate on this and any pull request will be accepted if they improve the extension. *All extensions are coded in JavaScript* and google has some great resources to learn more about developing chrome extensions. Here's a quick guide on compiling the extension:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Running NodeJS**

The chrome extension needs NodeJS to be compiled. I'm using version 14.5.3, but similar versions should work. You can see your node JS version by running `node -v` and if node isn't installed, head over to https://nodejs.org/

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Installing dependencies**

Every browser version (aka `extension/chrome`, `extension/firefox`, etc) is its own Node project. To install the dependencies, run `npm install` in your desired browser directory.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Compilation**

To compile the extension, run `npm run build:prod` in your desired browser directory. This will create or replace the contents of a directory called `dist`. This contains the code runnable by your browser. I won't specify how to load the extension onto your browser because its different for every browser, but the folder you want to load is the `dist` directory.
